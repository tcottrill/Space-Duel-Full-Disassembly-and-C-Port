/* pokey.h - a POKEY (Atari C012294) sound and RNG core, plain C11.
 *
 * Translated from the AAE emulator's POKEY core
 * (aae/aae/sndhrdwr/aae_pokey.cpp / .h).  The engine-free Pokey class
 * came back nearly whole: timers 1/2/4 and IRQEN/IRQST, serial (SEROUT/
 * SERIN/SKREST), keyboard (KBCODE/SKSTAT), and the eight POT reads all
 * work here, driven through a small host seam (ad_pokey_host) in place
 * of AAE's virtual PokeyHost - see ad_pokey_set_host() below.  What
 * stays dropped is the AAE adapter itself: PokeyHost, pokey_sh_*,
 * mixer/stream/timer calls, Read_pokey_regs, quad-pokey, MEM callbacks
 * - none of that is chip behaviour, it is AAE's engine wiring.  AUDF1-4/
 * AUDC1-4/AUDCTL/STIMER/SKCTL writes and RANDOM/ALLPOT reads need no
 * host at all, same as before; every register nothing answers still
 * reads back 0xFF.
 *
 * This is not a ROM routine - astdelux2_main.asm never names a "POKEY.C"
 * module, the chip is hardware the ROM merely talks to - so it carries
 * no ad_ prefix and no ROM address comments.  It has no platform
 * includes (no stdio, no Windows headers): this file must build on a
 * microcontroller as well as on Windows, same as the rest of c_src.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Time model (read this before touching read()/advance()/render()).
 *
 * The chip is exact given an exact clock feed, and charges nothing on
 * its own.  ad_pokey_advance(p, n) is the only thing that moves machine
 * time: it adds n POKEY cycles to the running `cycles` count (which the
 * ALLPOT pot-scan window measures against) and clocks the RANDOM shift
 * chain n times - in O(1) while the chip is running, one register step
 * at a time for the few clocks after an SKCTL or AUDCTL write where the
 * chip is still settling.  A RANDOM read just returns the byte the
 * chain holds; two reads with no advance between them return the same
 * byte.
 *
 * SKCTL's init bits clear do not stop the chain: the clock keeps
 * running, and what changes is what shifts in.  The 9-bit register
 * takes a zero at its head every clock, the 17-bit extension takes what
 * the (now constant) feedback gives it, and after 17 clocks the whole
 * chain has settled to a fixed state that RANDOM reads as 0xFF (from
 * the 8th clock on).  Released sooner, the chain resumes from a mix of
 * old and new bits.  Asteroids Deluxe's NMI holds it for about 29
 * cycles ("WASTE TIME" between the two SKCTL stores at $788F and
 * $7899), so on this board every release starts from the settled state;
 * a ROM that releases inside 17 cycles gets what the chip would give
 * it.  Time that passes while held is charged like any other time -
 * there is nothing to catch up on at release, because the chain never
 * stopped.  The audio side is held the old way: the transition into
 * reset zeroes the render's poly phases (one set of shift registers on
 * the chip), and ad_pokey_render() fires no channel event and moves no
 * poly phase while held - outputs sit at their current levels, the
 * sample clock alone keeps running.  The RANDOM chain and the render
 * phases stay separate copies: both count POKEY cycles, but the render
 * lags machine time by up to a host tick, and reconciling them at a
 * read would need the CPU cycle position this port does not have.
 *
 * The three hardware timers (TIMR1/TIMR2/TIMR4, driven by channels
 * 0/1/3) count down the same n-cycle slice ad_pokey_advance() walks:
 * each timer's countdown is stepped by n in O(1), and if n reaches or
 * passes it the channel's divisor is added back on as many times as it
 * takes to land past n - IRQST is a latch, so a slice that crosses
 * several periods still only raises the IRQ once.  SKCTL's init bits
 * clear stop the 15 kHz and 64 kHz clocks but not the 1.79 MHz one, so
 * a held chip's timers only count if their channel runs off the fast
 * clock (AUDCTL's CH1/CH3 fast-clock bits, and the joined partner of
 * such a channel); the slow-clock ones stand still until release,
 * keeping their phase.  The serial port runs off those borrows too:
 * SKCTL bits 4..6 pick timer 4 for the receiver and timer 4 or 2 for
 * the transmitter (or the board's external bit clock, which no host
 * here supplies, so that direction stands still), a bit is two borrows,
 * a frame ten bits.  A SEROUT byte is taken by the shifter at the next
 * borrow and raises "output data needed" then; it reaches the host's
 * serial_out() when its stop bit has left the pin; "transmission
 * finished" (IRQST bit 3) is a live level, low whenever the transmitter
 * is idle.  A byte arriving - the host's serial_in(), asked whenever
 * the receiver is idle, or ad_pokey_serial_receive() - lands in SERIN
 * ten bit periods later, raising the input IRQ, and the overrun latch
 * if the previous input IRQ was still pending.  IRQEN only gates whether
 * a borrow reaches the IRQST latch and the host's raise_irq() - it
 * never touches a countdown's phase, because the real timers keep
 * counting whether or not their IRQ is enabled; a countdown re-arms
 * (restarts a full period from now) only where AUDF/AUDCTL/STIMER
 * writes say it does - see ad_pokey_write().
 *
 * Who feeds the clock, and how exactly, is the host's business:
 *
 *   - coarse machine time: one NMI period (6048 POKEY cycles at
 *     1.512 MHz / 4 ms) right before ad_nmi(), because that is when the
 *     board's own clock would have ticked;
 *   - a stand-in per game read: this port has no 6502 with a cycle
 *     counter, so the hosts' ad_hw_random() advances a flat
 *     AD_RANDOM_READ_COST (64) before each un-annotated read - the
 *     polynomial has to move *something* between two reads in the same
 *     NMI, or a tight loop would see the identical byte.  A model, in
 *     the host, not in the chip;
 *   - exact deltas where a ROM cares: translated code that reads RANDOM
 *     twice in a short window calls ad_pokey_advance() with the true
 *     6502 cycle distance between the two bus strobes.  Tempest's
 *     protection at $AE1F (LDA abs then LDY abs on the same chip, both
 *     strobing on their fourth cycle) needs exactly 4 between the reads,
 *     and expects the upper nibble of the first byte to be the lower
 *     nibble of the second - see probe_pokey.c's check (5).
 *
 * Cycles here are POKEY cycles.  On this board and on Tempest the 6502
 * and POKEY share 12.096 MHz / 8, so one CPU cycle is one POKEY cycle
 * and a caller passes 6502 cycle counts straight through; a board with
 * a different ratio converts before calling.  Several chips on one
 * board (Tempest has two) must be advanced by the same amounts from the
 * same places, or their sequences drift apart.
